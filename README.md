# poesie
three poetry generators developed in VC6 (Visual C++ 6.0) 

This is the C++ source code for three poetry generation algorithms.

These are the the main subject of my book, written in German language, published in 2007:

Diesseits und jenseits des Hirsches: Die Entstehung einer Poesiemaschine

http://www.amazon.de/Diesseits-jenseits-Hirsches-Entstehung-Poesiemaschine/dp/3631566301

http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&seitentyp=produkt&pk=40491&cid=367&concordeid=56630

The book discusses this software and presents ideas about how future poetry software might work.

Unfortunately some of the WORDNET ( http://wordnet.princeton.edu/ ) files are no longer in the source base. 

A sincere attempt to reconstruct the functionality of this software would require hooking up the most recent version of WORDNET.

I have these files on an old computer and should try to get them at some point.
