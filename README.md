# poesie
three poetry generators developed in VC6 (Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0) in 2005.

This is the C++ source code for three poetry generation algorithms.

These are the the main subject of my book, written in German language, published in 2007:

Diesseits und jenseits des Hirsches: Die Entstehung einer Poesiemaschine

The book discusses this software and presents ideas about how future poetry software might work.

Unfortunately some of the WORDNET ( http://wordnet.princeton.edu/ ) files and CMU ( http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict ) files are no longer in the source base. 

A sincere attempt to reconstruct the functionality of this software would require hooking up the most recent version of WORDNET and the CMU dictionary.

I have these files on an old laptop computer (in the basement!) and should try to get them at some point. Anyway, I make this C++ source available first and foremost so that future poetry and NLP programmers may get some new insights or steal some existing ones.
